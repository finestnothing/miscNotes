<h2 id="sec.1.2_01-IN">Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An application is a computer program whose purpose is not directly tied to the inner workings of the computer, but with tasks performed by the user. Linux distributions offer many application options to perform a variety of tasks, such as office applications, web browsers, multimedia players and editors, etc. There is often more than one application or tool to perform a particular job. It is up to the user to choose the application which best fits their needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_software_packages">Software Packages</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Almost every Linux distribution offers a pre-installed set of default applications. Besides those pre-installed applications, a distribution has a package repository with a vast collection of applications available to install through its <em>package manager</em>. Although the various distributions offer roughly the same applications, several different package management systems exist for various distributions. For instance, Debian, Ubuntu and Linux Mint use the <code>dpkg</code>, <code>apt-get</code> and <code>apt</code> tools to install software packages, generally referred as <em>DEB packages</em>. Distributions such as Red Hat, Fedora and CentOS use the <code>rpm</code>, <code>yum</code> and <code>dnf</code> commands instead, which in turn install <em>RPM packages</em>. As the application packaging is different for each distribution family, it is very important to install packages from the correct repository designed to the particular distribution. The end user usually doesn&#8217;t have to worry about those details, as the distribution&#8217;s package manager will choose the right packages, the required dependencies and future updates. Dependencies are auxiliary packages needed by programs. For example, if a library provides functions for dealing with JPEG images which are used by multiple programs, this library is likely packaged in its own package on which all applications using the library depend.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The commands <code>dpkg</code> and <code>rpm</code> operate on individual package files. In practice, almost all package management tasks are performed by the commands <code>apt-get</code> or <code>apt</code> on systems that use DEB packages or by <code>yum</code> or <code>dnf</code> on systems that use RPM packages. These commands work with catalogues of packages, can download new packages and their dependencies, and check for newer versions of the installed packages.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_package_installation">Package Installation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose you have heard about a command called <code>figlet</code> which prints enlarged text on the terminal and you want to try it. However, you get the following message after executing the command <code>figlet</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ <strong>figlet</strong>
-bash: figlet: command not found</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That probably means the package is not installed on your system. If your distribution works with DEB packages, you can search its repositories using <code>apt-cache search package_name</code> or <code>apt search package_name</code>. The <code>apt-cache</code> command is used to search for packages and to list information about available packages. The following command looks for any occurrences of the term &#8220;figlet&#8221; in the package&#8217;s names and descriptions:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ <strong>apt-cache search figlet</strong>
figlet - Make large character ASCII banners out of ordinary text</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The search identified a package called <em>figlet</em> that corresponds to the missing command. The installation and removal of a package require special permissions granted only to the system&#8217;s administrator: the user named <code>root</code>. On desktop systems, ordinary users can install or remove packages by prepending the command <code>sudo</code> to the installation/removal commands. That will require you to type your password to proceed. For DEB packages, the installation is performed with the command <code>apt-get install package_name</code> or <code>apt install package_name</code>:</p>

<h3 id="_office_applications">Office Applications</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Office applications are used for editing files such as texts, presentations, spreadsheets and other formats commonly used in an office environment. These applications are usually organised in collections called <em>office suites</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a long time, the most used office suite in Linux was the <em>OpenOffice.org</em> suite. OpenOffice.org was an open source version of the <em>StarOffice suite</em> released by <em>Sun Microsystems</em>. A few years later Sun was acquired by <em>Oracle Corporation</em>, which in turn transferred the project to the <em>Apache Foundation</em> and OpenOffice.org was renamed to <em>Apache OpenOffice</em>. Meanwhile, another office suite based on the same source code was released by the <em>Document Foundation</em>, which named it <em>LibreOffice</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The two projects have the same basic features and are compatible with the document formats from <em>Microsoft Office</em>. However, the preferred document format is the <em>Open Document Format</em>, a fully open and ISO standardized file format. The use of ODF files ensures that documents can be transferred between operating systems and applications from different vendors, such as Microsoft Office. The main applications offered by OpenOffice/LibreOffice are:</p>

<p>Both LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice are open source software, but LibreOffice is licensed under LGPLv3 and Apache OpenOffice is licensed under Apache License 2.0. The licensing distinction implies that LibreOffice can incorporate improvements made by Apache OpenOffice, but Apache OpenOffice cannot incorporate improvements made by LibreOffice. That, and a more active community of developers, are the reason most distributions adopt LibreOffice as their default office suite.</p>

<p>There are also many applications dedicated to multimedia playback. The most popular application for video playback is <em>VLC</em>, but some users prefer other alternatives, like <em>smplayer</em>. Local music playback also has many options, like <em>Audacious</em>, <em>Banshee</em> and <em>Amarok</em>, which can also manage a collection of local sound files.</p>

<h3 id="_server_programs">Server Programs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a web browser loads a page from a website, it actually connects to a remote computer and asks for a specific piece of information. In that scenario, the computer running the web browser is called the <em>client</em> and the remote computer is called the <em>server</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The server computer, which can be an ordinary desktop computer or specialized hardware, needs a specific program to manage each type of information it will provide. Regarding serving web pages, most servers around the world deploy open source server programs. This particular server program is called an <em>HTTP server</em> (HTTP stands for <em>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol</em>) and the most popular ones are <em>Apache</em>, <em>Nginx</em> and <em>lighttpd</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even simple web pages may require many requests, which can be ordinary files&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;called static content&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;or dynamic content rendered from various sources. The role of an HTTP server is to collect and send all the requested data back to the browser, which then arranges the content as defined by the received HTML document (HTML stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em>) and other supporting files. Therefore, the rendering of a web page involves operations performed on the server side and operations performed on the client side. Both sides can use custom scripts to accomplish specific tasks. On the HTTP server side, it is quite common to use the PHP scripting language. JavaScript is the scripting language used on the client side (the web browser).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Server programs can provide all kinds of information. It&#8217;s not uncommon to have a server program requesting information provided by other server programs. That is the case when an HTTP server requires information provided by a database server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For instance, when a dynamic page is requested, the HTTP server usually queries a database to collect all the required pieces of information and sends the dynamic content back to the client. In a similar way, when a user registers on a website, the HTTP server gathers the data sent by the client and stores it in a database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A database is an organized set of information. A database server stores contents in a formatted fashion, making it possible to read, write and link large amounts of data reliably and at great speed. Open source database servers are used in many applications, not only on the Internet. Even local applications can store data by connecting to a local database server. The most common type of database is the <em>relational database</em>, where the data is organized in predefined tables. The most popular open source relational databases are <em>MariaDB</em> (originated from <em>MySQL</em>) and <em>PostgreSQL</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_data_sharing">Data Sharing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In local networks, like the ones found in offices and homes, it is desirable that computers not only should be able to access the Internet, but also should be able to communicate with each other. Sometimes a computer acts as a server, sometimes the same computer acts as a client. That is necessary when one wants to access files on another computer in the network&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for instance, access a file stored on a desktop computer from a portable device&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;without the hassle of copying it to a USB drive or the like.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Between Linux machines, <em>NFS</em> (<em>Network File System</em>) is often used. The NFS protocol is the standard way to share file systems in networks equipped only with Unix/Linux machines. With NFS, a computer can share one or more of its directories with specific computers on the network, so they can read and write files in these directories. NFS can even be used to share an entire operating system&#8217;s directory tree with clients that will use it to boot from. These computers, called <em>thin clients</em>, are mostly often used in large networks to avoid the maintenance of each individual operating system on each machine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If there are other types of operating systems attached to the network, it is recommended to use a data sharing protocol that can be understood by all of them. This requirement is fulfilled by <em>Samba</em>. Samba implements a protocol for sharing files over the network originally made for the Windows operating system, but today is compatible with all major operating systems. With Samba, computers in the local network not only can share files, but also printers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On some local networks, the authorization given upon login on a workstation is granted by a central server, called the <em>domain controller</em>, which manages the access to various local and remote resources. The domain controller is a service provided by Microsoft&#8217;s <em>Active Directory</em>. Linux workstations can associate with a domain controller by using Samba or an authentication subsystem called <em>SSSD</em>. As of version 4, Samba can also work as a domain controller on heterogeneous networks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the goal is to implement a cloud computing solution able to provide various methods of web based data sharing, two alternatives should be considered: <em>ownCloud</em> and <em>Nextcloud</em>. The two projects are very similar because Nextcloud is a spin-off of ownCloud, which is not unusual among open source projects. Such spin-offs are usually called a <em>fork</em>. Both provide the same basic features: file sharing and sync, collaborative workspaces, calendar, contacts and mail, all through desktop, mobile and web interfaces. Nextcloud also provides private audio/video conferencing, whilst ownCloud is more focused on file sharing and integration with third-party software. Many more features are provided as plugins which can be activated later as needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both ownCloud and Nextcloud offer a paid version with extra features and extended support. What makes them different from other commercial solutions is the ability to install Nextcloud or ownCloud on a private server, free of charge, avoiding keeping sensitive data on an unknown server. As all the services depend on HTTP communication and are written in PHP, the installation must be performed on a previous configured web server, like Apache. If you consider installing ownCloud or Nextcloud on your own server, make sure to also enable HTTPS to encrypt all connections to your cloud.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="_network_administration">Network Administration</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Communication between computers is only possible if the network is working correctly. Normally, the network configuration is done by a set of programs running on the router, responsible for setting up and checking the network availability. In order to achieve this, two basic network services are used: <em>DHCP</em> (<em>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</em>) and <em>DNS</em> (<em>Domain Name System</em>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DHCP is responsible for assigning an IP address to the host when a network cable is connected or when the device enters a wireless network. When connecting to the Internet, the ISP&#8217;s DHCP server will provide an IP address to the requesting device. A DHCP server is very useful in local area networks also, to automatically provide IP addresses to all connected devices. If DHCP is not configured or if it&#8217;s not working properly, it would be necessary to manually configure the IP address of each device connected to the network. It is not practical to manually set the IP addresses on large networks or even in small networks, that&#8217;s why most network routers come with a DHCP server pre-configured by default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IP address is required to communicate with another device on an IP network, but domain names like <code>www.lpi.org</code> are much more likely to be remembered than an IP number like <code>203.0.113.165</code>. The domain name by itself, however, is not enough to establish the communication through the network. That is why the domain name needs to be translated to an IP address by a DNS server. The IP address of the DNS server is provided by the ISP&#8217;s DHCP server and it&#8217;s used by all connected systems to translate domain names to IP addresses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both DHCP and DNS settings can be modified by entering the web interface provided by the router. For instance, it is possible to restrict the IP assignment only to known devices or associate a fixed IP address to specific machines. It&#8217;s also possible to change the default DNS server provided by the ISP. Some third-party DNS servers, like the ones provided by Google or OpenDNS, can sometimes provide faster responses and extra features.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_programming_languages">Programming Languages</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All computer programs (client and server programs, desktop applications and the operating system itself) are made using one or more programming languages. Programs can be a single file or a complex system of hundreds of files, which the operating system treats as an instruction sequence to be interpreted and performed by the processor and other devices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are numerous programming languages for very different purposes and Linux systems provide a lot of them. Since open source software also includes the sources of the programs, Linux systems offer developers perfect conditions to understand, modify or create software according to their own needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every program begins as a text file, called <em>source code</em>. This source code is written in a more or less human-friendly language that describes what the program is doing. A computer processor can not directly execute this code. In <em>compiled languages</em>, the source code is therefore be converted to a <em>binary file</em> which can then be executed by the computer. A program called <em>compiler</em> is responsible for doing the conversion from source code to executable form. Since the compiled binary is specific to one kind of processor, the program might have to be re-compiled to run on another type of computer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <em>interpreted languages</em>, the program does not need to be previously compiled. Instead, an <em>interpreter</em> reads the source code and executes its instruction every time the program is run. This makes the development easier and faster, but at the same time interpreted programs tend to be slower than compiled programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here some of the most popular programming languages:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">JavaScript</dt>
<dd>
<p>JavaScript is a programming language mostly used in web pages. In its origins, JavaScript applications were very simple, like form validation routines. As for today, JavaScript is considered a first class language and it is used to create very complex applications not only on the web, but on servers and mobile devices.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">C</dt>
<dd>
<p>The C programming language is closely related with operating systems, particularly Unix, but it is used to write any kind of program to almost any kind of device. The great advantages of C are flexibility and speed. The same source code written in C can be compiled to run in different platforms and operating systems, with little or no modification. After being compiled, however, the program will run only in the targeted system.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Java</dt>
<dd>
<p>The main aspect of Java is that programs written in this language are portable, which means that the same program can be executed in different operating systems. Despite the name, Java is not related to JavaScript.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Perl</dt>
<dd>
<p>Perl is a programming language most used to process text content. It has a strong regular expressions emphasis, which makes Perl a language suited for text filtering and parsing.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Shell</dt>
<dd>
<p>The shell, particularly the Bash shell, is not just a programming language, but an interactive interface to run other programs. Shell programs, known as <em>shell scripts</em>, can automate complex or repetitive tasks on the command line environment.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Python</dt>
<dd>
<p>Python is a very popular programming language among students and professionals not directly involved with computer science. Whilst having advanced features, Python is a good way to start learning programming for its easy to use approach.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">PHP</dt>
<dd>
<p>PHP is most used as a server side scripting language for generating content for the web. Most online HTML pages are not static files, but dynamic content generated by the server from various sources, like databases. PHP programs&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;sometimes just called PHP pages or PHP scripts&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;are often used to generate this kind of content. The term LAMP comes from the combination of a Linux operating system, an Apache HTTP server, a MySQL (or MariaDB) database and PHP programming. LAMP servers are a very popular solution for running web servers. Besides PHP, all of the programming languages described before can be used to implement such applications too.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>C and Java are compiled languages. In order to be executed by the system, source code written in C is converted to binary machine code, whereas Java source code is converted to <em>bytecode</em> executed in a special software environment called <em>Java Virtual Machine</em>. JavaScript, Perl, Shell script, Python and PHP are all interpreted languages, which are also called <em>scripting languages</em>.</p>
