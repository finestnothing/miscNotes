## Video 2: Informed Search

## Video 3: Dijkstra's vs Greedy vs A*

Djikstra's orders all nodes based on their g(n) value - the value already travelled.  
Greedy search orders nodes on h(n) - distance remaining  
A* Search balances these using f(n) = g(n) + h(n) which is the estimated path cost from start node through new node n to the goal.

Djikstra: Blind search. Greedy and A*: informed search
