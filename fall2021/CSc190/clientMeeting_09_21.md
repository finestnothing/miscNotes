# Client Meeting 09/21/2021

Help me Michaels puns, you're my only hope.

## Requirements

Need to submit project proposal. Wanting to get document from Verma to fill this out.

Wants us to put down deliverable for SP class, include Verma in document/email chain.

Will do client interviews once we get basic document down (from USDOT, caltrans, intel, etc) to figure out uses etc.
Will have us capture requirements, make requirements document, identify questions to ask clients, etc.

Recommends a Use-case, sequence diagrams, functional and non-functional requirements, etc. Project is working towards business objective. We determine users, actors, constraints, etc.

## Project Information

Wanting to capture optical signal capture information.
How will we verify no one else will be able to access the information, who will want to use it, etc.

Put Glocol Networks as client for now. People from USDOT and CalTrans will be subject matter experts, not the clients.

Think about project conceptually. See if we can determine good ways to identify the information that the ML will need to know.
What makes each stoplight distinct? Ways to split them up? How do we identify them?

October 8 and 9 Workshop, will probably present what we have.
