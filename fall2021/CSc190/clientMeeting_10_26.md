Verma is cheating on us with another group, this cannot stand.

    - UI looks sexy according to Verma
    - May not want all the picture of the intersection
        - May just want the phases, lights, etc

    - Next Tuesday to finalize it. Want to see when Walt is available.
    - Next friday/next saturday, etc

    - Want to make data from our pi's interchangeable with the existing SPAT systems
- AWS will be used for encryption part of the project (?)
- This sprint should be an intro to the coding
    - Wants us to start working on traffic light detection
    - Compare multiple alternatives
        - Look at AWS, intel, etc
        - [AWS Machine Learning](https://aws.amazon.com/free/machine-learning/?trk=ps_a131L0000057XooQAE&trkCampaign=acq_paid_search&sc_channel=ps&sc_campaign=acquisition_us&sc_publisher=google&sc_category=Machine%20Learning&sc_country=US&sc_geo=NAMER&sc_outcome=acq&sc_detail=object%20recognition&sc_content=recognition_p&sc_matchtype=p&sc_segment=549437827636&sc_medium=ACQ-P|PS-GO|Non-Brand|Desktop|SU|Machine%20Learning|Recognition|US|EN|Text&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!549437827636!p!!g!!object%20recognition&ef_id=CjwKCAjwzt6LBhBeEiwAbPGOgWK2beUzDwjvq1y3Y29KSL3vP8WDGXMUdlp3TKutJPOw4bHtbWKjYBoCgjoQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!549437827636!p!!g!!object%20recognition)

- Verma seems to like the idea of capturing traffic info as well
    - Nothing official, may just be something to capture in the future
- Prototype 2
    - Wants video w/ overlay, etc
        - Not necessarily actual result from ML, but at least demo of result
