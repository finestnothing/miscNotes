Context diagram  
Business event table  
Backlog  
Meeting minutes  

## Sprint 02

### Prototype

Showing in lab meeting  
Had meeting with client. Need to meet with USDOT/CALTRANS before we can improve or finalize prototype.  
Waiting on client input (see above) but Verma was happy.  

Our project isn't UI based, mainly backend. 

- Wants us to refine prototype.
    - On click: new interface, etc
    - Need to think about different functionality that we could have

### Execution Report

Looks good  
Everyone needs at least 3-4 hours per sprint. Lot of pins still in progress.  

### Backlog

Going through it, no complaints about it

### Finishing Sprint 02

Plan to have it all submitted this weekend (only waiting on retrospective and lab notes)  

### Retrospective

Learned: Managing the required documents etc
