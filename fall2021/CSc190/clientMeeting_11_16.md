# Meeting 11/16/2021

Verma wasn't about to miss this meeting, no way Jose. Actually, he's just late to his other thing.

- Letting Verma know that we are presenting soon, need to create a backlog.
- Verma wants a summary of what we have accomplished so far.
- By tomorrow, Verma wants the json file from mapping an intersection.
- If we have gone out there, make notes in a file somewhere. Add pictures etc to make sure everyone understands what we are looking at.
- Attempting to make a meeting on Saturday
- Wants to apply our project to the real world when possible
- He's gone, that's so Harsh
