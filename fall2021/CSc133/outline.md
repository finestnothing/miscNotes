# Outline of changes for A3

- Draw function for all 4 gameObjects  
    - All bounding boxes are squares, but each object has a different shape
    - Flag: filled isosceles triangles
        - size is length and height of triangles
        - Also shows the flag number (from drawString())
    - Foodstations: filled squares
        - size is length and height of squares
        - Also shows capacity (from drawString())
    - Ant: filled circles
        - size is diameter
    - spiders: unfilled isocleses triangles
    - Interface IDrawable:
        - draw(Graphics g, Point pCmpRelPrnt)
        - GameObject will implement this
- mapView will display game contents graphically
    - When mapView update is invoked, call repaint()
        - paint() will iterate through all objects and draw their new locations
- Enforce size of game area
- automatic ticks rather than 1 at a time  
    - Using UITimer build in class
    - Game should implement Runnable (built in interface)
    - Each tick of UITimer invokes the tick() method
    - Movement needs to be based on elapsed time (20ms etc)
        - Experiment to get an fair movement speed
    - Play/pause button
        - UITimer starts when schedule() is called
        - UITimer stops when cancel() is called
        - To restart, call schedule() again
        - For toggle, need to determine if UITimer is running
- Collision Detection
    - Need interface ICollider
        - Declares collidesWith(ICollider other)
        - Declares handleCollision(ICollider other)
    - When ant moves, check if it is colliding with any other object
        - If so, call the appropriate collision method in GameWorld
            - FoodStation: eatFood()
            - Flag: flagCollision()
            - Spider: spiderCollision()
        - Add object to list of of recently collided objects (to be cleared after several ticks)
            - This is to prevent multiple collisions from happening in a single tick or before ant can move away
        - All collisions require a sound
            - Spider: squeak?
            - Flag: Cheering?
            - FoodStation: Crunch?
- Remove the simulate buttons, commands, and keybinds
    - spider collision
    - flag collision
    - foodstation collision
    - tick()
- Sound
    - sound on/off function updates
    - sounds for collisions (see above)
    - ambient sound: eye of the tiger?
- Game Modes
    - Play and pause
        - Play: UITimer starts, sounds on, etc. Normal gameplay.
        - Pause
            - UITimer stops, sounds off, no movement
            - Make all objects selectable with an ISelectable interface (see below)
    - ISelectable Interface
        - For fixed objects, flags and foodstations
        - When selected, highlight object with an unfilled matching shape
        - Only one object can be selected at a time, if clicking outside of selected object, deselect the current shape
        - Allows user to perform certain actions (empty, fill, activate flag, etc)
        - When switching back to play, deselect object
